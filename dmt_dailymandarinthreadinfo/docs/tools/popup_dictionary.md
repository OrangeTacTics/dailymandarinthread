When reading Mandarin online, itâ€™s very convenient to have a pop-up dictionary plugin for your browser. When enabled, these let you hover your cursor over a Chinese word and see the pronunciation and the meaning without having to leave the page. Zhengwen is a good out-of-the-box extension. Yomichan is a popular extension that requires some setup, but which lets you use custom dictionaries.
