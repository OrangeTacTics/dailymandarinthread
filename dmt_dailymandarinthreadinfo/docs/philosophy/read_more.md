> "If you want to improve in the language, whether it's Japanese or Portuguese, *read more*! And listen." - Steve Koffman

At its core, the DMT Method is simple:

* Read more.
* And listen.

Everything else in language learning is just there to support the learner's ability to read in the langauge and to listen effectively.

If you haven't gotten to the point yet in Mandarin that you can read anything, then that's where you must begin. The [Beginner goals](`/method/beginner_goals/`) is where to start.

Once you are at a level where you can read anything at all, your only mission is to make reading in Chinese part of your life. This means reading extensively with easy material. This means doing small amounts of intensive reading above your level. This means not giving up when you're having a bad week. This means coming to peace with the fear you never feel like you'll know all of the words. It means reading. This means enjoying the language, regardless of your level.
