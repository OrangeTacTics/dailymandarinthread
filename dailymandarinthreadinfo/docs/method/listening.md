While our ultimate goal is to get to a point where we can read, we have to contend with the fact that our minds are pre-wired to learn spoken language. All it takes is enough focused exposure, and it happens automatically. This is obvious, since every person is able to learn their first language.

The first beginner goal of the DMT Method is to get a lot of exposure to the spoken language. We recommend 100 hours as a baseline.

A typical TV show contains about 20 minutes of content. To reach 100 hours in 6 months, this amounts to two episodes a day.

At the beginner stage, any spoken content will do as long as you find it compelling. Because we are looking for just the "taste" of the language, the difficulty doesn't matter. You aren't listening to understand the dialog. You simply want exposure to the sound of the language. This lets your subconscious mind make connections and pick up on habits and patterns you will see in the language for the rest of your journey.
