Studying grammar is learning. And learning is not acquiring.

We aim only to learn enough that we can make sense of the sentences we encounter. Grammar explanations should be short.

For example:

* 吗 (mā) is a spoken question mark.

* 的 (de) is like adding ‘s onto a word.

* Verbs don’t conjugate. You can add the word 了(le) make it past tense.

These are easy to remember and purposefully incomplete. The next time you come across any of these words, you might understand the sentence better than you would have otherwise.
